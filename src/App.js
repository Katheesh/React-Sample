        <p> I love to coding and have done so for 10,000 hours over the past four years. I‚Äôm great at knowing the right algorithm for a problem because I read computer science literature constantly. I like Algorithms based problems. I love working with people to do things bigger than I could accomplish alone. I‚Äôm motivated by big problems, and I think you‚Äôve got some here that I can help solve.‚Äù</p>
